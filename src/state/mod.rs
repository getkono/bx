//! The state directory — `$XDG_STATE_HOME/bx`, default `~/.local/state/bx`.
//!
//! bx's layout has two halves. The *config repo* is a git working tree the user
//! owns, commits and publishes. The **state directory** is the other half: it is
//! never a git working tree, never published, and holds only what the machine
//! needs to know about this account — what bx wrote, what it replaced, and what
//! it can skip recomputing.
//!
//! # Every file here is reconstructible
//!
//! A machine-owned file that becomes an error the user cannot clear is a defect,
//! so damage is never fatal. A truncated, garbled, wrong-kind or
//! future-versioned file is moved aside to a fixed `<name>.corrupt`, reported
//! through `tracing::warn!`, and replaced by the empty default; the next save
//! writes a clean file. The damaged bytes are kept, never deleted, so a human or
//! `bx doctor` can still look at them. See [`Damage`] and [`Health`].
//!
//! # A note on network filesystems
//!
//! The lock is `flock(2)`. On a home directory mounted over NFS with `nolock`,
//! `flock` silently provides no exclusion at all. bx's state directory is
//! per-account local storage by design, so this is documented rather than
//! handled.
//!
//! # Resolution takes an explicit home
//!
//! [`StateDir::resolve`] takes the home directory as an argument and reads no
//! environment variable. Two tests with two tempdir `$HOME`s therefore get two
//! independent state directories. The XDG rule itself lives in exactly one place
//! — [`crate::paths::xdg_base`] — and a caller that has an `$XDG_STATE_HOME`
//! value to honour passes it to [`StateDir::resolve_in`].
